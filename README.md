In the Following Project till now I have Just created Machine Learning Algorithm Part still many part is remaning.

In the Following Project I have used Linear Regression Model Which is best suited for Project Like these and also tested different models but Linear Regression got me 84.76% accuracy and also removed many outliers and also I would like to Thank Codebasics Youtube Channel which Helped me do this Project.
